  abstract={Prior work on human-algorithmic bias has seen difficulty in empirically identifying the underlying mechanisms of bias, because in a typical "one-time" decision-making scenario, different mechanisms tend to generate the same patterns of observable decisions. In this study, leveraging a unique repeat decision-making setting in a high-stakes micro-lending context, we aim to uncover the underlying source, evolution dynamics, and associated impacts of bias. We first develop and estimate a structural econometric model of the decision dynamics to understand the source and evolution of potential bias in human evaluators in microloan granting. We find that both preference-based bias and belief-based bias are present in human evaluators' decisions and are in favor of female applicants. Through counterfactual simulations, we quantify the effects of the two types of bias on both fairness and profits. The results show that the elimination of either of the two biases improves the fairness in financial resource allocation, as well as the platform profits. The profit improvement mainly stems from the increase in the approval probability for male borrowers, especially those who would eventually pay back loans. Furthermore, to examine how human biases evolve when being inherited by machine learning (ML) algorithms, we then train a set of state-of-the-art ML algorithms for default risk prediction on both real-world datasets with human biases encoded within and counterfactual datasets with human biases partially or fully removed. By comparing the decision outcomes in different counterfactual settings, we find that even fairness-unaware ML algorithms can reduce bias present in human loan-granting decisions. Interestingly, while removing both types of human biases from the training data can further improve ML fairness, the fairness-enhancing effects vary significantly between new and repeat applicants. Based on our findings, we discuss how to reduce decision bias most effectively in a human-machine learning pipeline.},

Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD."

  abstract={Deep learning (DL) techniques have recently been applied to anomaly detection (AD), with numerous successful applications in finance, medical service, cloud computing, etc. However, current research often directly evaluates a deep AD algorithm as a whole, which cannot disentangle the contribution of each design choice (e.g., loss functions and network architectures). Meanwhile, we may neglect the contribution of other meaningful prerequisite steps like preprocessing by giving all credits to newly designed loss functions and/or architectures. In this paper, we address the above gaps by answering: (i) which components (i.e., design choices) of deep AD methods play crucial roles in detecting anomalies? (ii) how can we build more effective AD algorithms given different datasets by automatically choosing the optimal design choices other than using existing off-the-shelf ones? To this end, we propose ADGym, the first and fully open-source design platform for large evaluation and automatic selection of AD design choices. Extensive experiments show that directly using existing leading methods is not optimal, and the AD models composed by ADGym significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.}

We present an effective method to train multilingual IR systems when only English IR training data is available, by leveraging parallel and non-parallel corpora to improve the pretrained multilingual language models’ cross-lingual transfer ability. We design a semantic contrastive loss to align representations of parallel sentences that share the same semantics in different languages, and a new language contrastive loss to leverage parallel sentence pairs to remove language-specific information in sentence representations from non-parallel corpora. When trained on English IR data with these losses and evaluated zero-shot on non-English data, our model demonstrates significant improvement to prior work on retrieval performance, while it requires much less computational effort. Our model can work well even with a small number of parallel sentences, and it can be used as an add-on module to any backbone and other tasks.}

(1) evaluating fourteen methods with backbone spanning from classical matrix factorization to the latest graph neural networks;
(2) benchmarking the method performance with different types of injected outliers and organic outliers on real-world datasets;

  author={Hu, Xiyang and Huang, Yan and Li, Beibei and Lu, Tian},

  abstract={We propose an adversarial deep learning model for credit risk modeling. We make use of sophisticated machine learning model’s ability to triangulate (i.e., infer the sensitive group affiliation by using only permissible features), which is often deemed “troublesome” in fair machine learning research, in a positive way to increase both borrower welfare and lender profits while improving fairness. We train and test our model on a dataset from a real-world microloan company. Our model significantly outperforms regular deep neural networks without adversaries and the most popular credit risk model XGBoost, in terms of both improving borrowers’ welfare and lenders’ profits. Our empirical findings also suggest that the traditional AUC metric cannot reflect a model's performance on the borrowers’ welfare and lenders’ profits. Our framework is ready to be customized for other microloan firms, and can be easily adapted to many other decision-making scenarios.},

  abstract={Outlier detection refers to the identification of data points that deviate from a general data distribution. Existing unsupervised approaches often suffer from high computational cost, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited interpretability, especially when working with large, high-dimensional datasets. To address these issues, we present a simple yet effective algorithm called ECOD (Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection), which is inspired by the fact that outliers are often the "rare events" that appear in the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the underlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by computing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD then uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per dimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each data point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method called ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed support) Python implementation for accessibility and reproducibility.}

  journal={Conference on Machine Learning and Systems},
  abstract={Outlier detection (OD) is a key data mining task for identifying abnormal objects from general samples with numerous high-stake applications including fraud detection and intrusion detection. Due to the lack of ground truth labels, practitioners often have to build a large number of unsupervised models that are heterogeneous (i.e., different algorithms and hyperparameters) for further combination and analysis with ensemble learning, rather than relying on a single model. However, this yields severe scalability issues on high-dimensional, large datasets. How to accelerate the training and predicting with a large number of heterogeneous unsupervised OD models? How to ensure the acceleration does not deteriorate detection models' accuracy? How to accommodate the acceleration need for both a single worker setting and a distributed system with multiple workers? In this study, we propose a three-module acceleration system called SUOD (scalable unsupervised outlier detection) to address these questions. It focuses on three complementary aspects to accelerate (dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional data, model approximation for complex models, and execution efficiency improvement for taskload imbalance within distributed systems), while controlling detection performance degradation. Extensive experiments on more than 20 benchmark datasets demonstrate SUOD's effectiveness in heterogeneous OD acceleration. By the submission time, the released open-source system has been widely used with more than 700,000 times downloads. A real-world deployment case on fraudulent claim analysis at IQVIA, a leading healthcare firm, is also provided.},

The problem that has plagued decision tree algorithms since their inception is their lack of optimality, or lack of guarantees of closeness to optimality: decision tree algorithms are often greedy or myopic, and sometimes produce unquestionably suboptimal models. Hardness of decision tree optimization is both a theoretical and practical obstacle, and even careful mathematical programming approaches have not been able to solve these problems efficiently. This work introduces the first practical algorithm for optimal decision trees for binary variables. The algorithm is a co-design of analytical bounds that reduce the search space and modern systems techniques, including data structures and a custom bit-vector library. Our experiments highlight advantages in scalability, speed, and proof of optimality.},
