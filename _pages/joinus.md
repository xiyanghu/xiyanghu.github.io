## **🚀 Join the GLAD Lab!**  

Are you **passionate about Generative AI, LLM-powered agents, Trustworthy AI, Human-AI Collaboration, and Computational Social Science**? Do you want to work on cutting-edge research that makes an impact? If so, I invite you to join the **Generative Learning and Augmented Decision (GLAD) Lab**! 

We are more than just a research lab—we are a **tight-knit community**. At GLAD, we believe that groundbreaking research happens in an environment where people feel **supported, encouraged, and inspired**. If you are eager to **push boundaries, tackle challenging research problems, and publish in top venues—while being part of a collaborative and supportive team**—we would love to have you on board! 🚀

---

### **Who Should Apply?**  
We are looking for students who are:  
✅ **Strong in programming** (Python/C++, with experience in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch)  
✅ **Solid in mathematical foundations** (e.g., probability, statistics, linear algebra, optimization)  
✅ **Knowledgeable in AI/ML** (machine learning, data mining, or AI fundamentals)  
✅ **Passionate about research** (publications in ML or interdisciplinary venues are a plus, but not required)  
✅ **Self-motivated, curious, and ready to take initiative** – we encourage students to **lead projects and publish at top venues!**  

If you thrive in an environment where **innovation meets impact**, we want you on board!

> 💡 If you are interested in working with me, **please read the instructions below and fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK49daEc5MPc5WeE4NyvH73lihwTPay40cbExpYnIpW8LfzA/viewform?usp=dialog)**.

### **Opportunities at the GLAD Lab**  

#### 🎓 **Ph.D. Students**  
I currently advise Ph.D. students in the following two programs at ASU. If you're interested in pursuing doctoral research with me, I warmly encourage you to apply to both programs to maximize your chances of admission. Admission decisions are made by a committee, and students have the opportunity to collaborate with multiple exceptional faculties in the program.  
🔸 **Ph.D. in Computer Information Systems**  
🔸 **Ph.D. in Data Science**  

#### 💻 **Master’s Students (ASU)**  
If you're a Master’s student at ASU interested in research, I recommend that you first complete at least one of the following machine learning–related courses **before reaching out**:  
📌 **CSE 475** Foundations of Machine Learning  
📌 **CSE 476** Introduction to Natural Language Processing  
📌 **CSE 569** Fundamentals of Statistical Learning and Pattern Recognition  
📌 **CSE 572** Data Mining  
📌 **CSE 575** Statistical Machine Learning  
📌 **CSE 576** Topics in Natural Language Processing  

These courses will help ensure you have the foundational knowledge needed to contribute meaningfully to research projects.

If you're enrolled in the **MS in Data Science, Analytics, and Engineering** program and are interested in doing a thesis with me, you're welcome to reach out after completing one or more of the above courses **and** reviewing my papers to identify overlapping research interests.

#### 🔬 **Undergraduate Students (ASU)**  
I am always excited to work with **highly motivated undergraduates** at ASU! If you have a strong interest in AI/ML research, here are some ways to get involved:  
🔹 **Strong coursework performance in AI/ML-related subjects** (such as **CSE 475/476** or equivalent)  
🔹 **Participation in hackathons and research competitions**  
🔹 **Involvement in ASU’s FURI/SURI/GCSP programs**  


#### 🌍 **Interns & Visiting Students**  
We occasionally host **exceptional self-funded visiting students and interns**. To be considered, you should have:  
🔹 Prior research experience (e.g., **published papers** or strong recommendations from researchers I know)  
🔹 A well-defined research focus that aligns with **GLAD Lab’s mission**
